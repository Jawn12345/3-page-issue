      <h2>About Sea Turtles</h2>
      <p>Sea turtles are an ancient species, dating back to about 220 million years
        ago. These ancient animals have lived in our waters since the time of the
        dinosaurs. Their average lifespan is about 30 to 100 years, but the upper
        limits are still unknowned to scientists. There are 7 different species of
        sea turtles living in the world today, and they are the Leatherback, Green,
        Hawksbill, Loggerhead, Olive Ridly, Kemp's Ridley, and Flatback.
        </p>
      <p>Sea turtles are characterized by their shell and non-retractile head and
        limbs, meaning that they cannot put their heads and limbs inside their shell.
        The top part of their shell is called the carapace while the bottom part
        is called a plastrong. Most species of sea turtles, except the green turtle,
        are omnivorous. Some species of sea turtles specializes on a certain prey.
        For example, Hawksbill Sea Turtles primarily eat sea sponges and Leatherback
        Sea Turtles eat jellyfishes and sea squirts.
        </p>
      <p>Sea turtles live most of their lives in the sea; however, they periodic
        come ashore to lay their eggs. Sea turtles have the ability of magnetoreception,
        or the ability to detect the Earth's magnetic field. They use this ability
        to help them return to their nesting grounds to lay their eggs. Like many
        species of reptiles, the temperature of the developing eggs is what ultimately
        determines the sex of the offspring. Higher temperatures produce more female
        offsprings while lower temperatures produce more male offsprings. After eggs
        hatch, baby sea turtles have to make a mad dash to ocean at night, avoiding predators
        such as birds and crabs. They have the tendency to move in the brightest
        direction, which is typically the moonlight reflected over the ocean.

      <h2>Why are happening to Sea Turtles</h2>
      <p>Out of the 7 species of sea turtles, nearly all of them are classified as
        endangered or vulnerable species, with 2 of them being critically endangered.
        The 2 endangered species are the Hawksbill and the Kemp's Ridley. There are
        numerous reasons for the significant decline in sea turtle population. These
        include bycatch, light pollution, poaching, habitat destruction, platic waste,
        and more.
